# Code Style & Conventions

## General Guidelines
- Use `termcolor` for printing messages at every step to keep users informed
- Always include `encoding="utf-8"` when using `with open` for consistent file encoding
- Define **major variables** in **ALL CAPS** at the top of scripts (except user input)
- Avoid embedding user input in variable definitions unless explicitly required

## File Organization
- **Maximum 200 lines of code per file**
- Split large files into smaller, focused modules
- Use meaningful file names that reflect their purpose
- Group related functionality together
- Extract reusable logic into separate utility files

## Error Handling
- Use `try-except` blocks with **descriptive error messages**
- Ensure error outputs are informative and include exception details
- Example:
```python
try:
    result = some_operation()
except SomeException as e:
    print(f"Error during operation: {e}")
    raise
```

## Design Principles
- Implement **Separation of Concerns** in every project
- Enhance modularity and maintainability
- Keep functions focused on single responsibilities

## TypeScript/JavaScript
- Use strict TypeScript configuration
- Prefer type-safe patterns
- Use proper async/await patterns
- Implement proper error boundaries in React components
